<h3>Details of the encoding</h3><p>Verse numbers are not marked in the original. The relevant numbers have been supplied in the markup, within the seg-element, and are displayed in the output files for ease of reference. Direct speech and other quotations are not explicitly marked in the original either, but have been tagged using the q-element in the transcription. For details of the structural markup for chapters and verses, see the notes to the 1588 Bible.</p><p>The text includes extensive marginal glosses of a linguistic nature. In the transcription, the word or phrase glossed is marked up using the term-element, and the gloss itself immediately follows, marked up using the gloss-element. Note that although the glosses are placed within the line in the transcription, that are always marginal glosses in the original. In the output files, glosses have been placed in square brackets, and the terms to which they apply are underlined.</p><p>In cases where words or parts of words are written in a different font to indicate that the word may be read in its entirety, or with the extra letters omitted (see above), the transcription tags the words or letters marked out in this way using the hi-element with the rend-attribute "antiqua" (for instance, the example mentioned above is represented as die&lt;hi rend="antiqua"&gt;rnot&lt;/hi&gt;.</p><p>The text contains three special characters: hooked l (for &lt;ll&gt;), eth (dd) (for &lt;dd&gt;) and a double v (vv) (for &lt;w&gt;). These are represented in the TEI-transcription using the character entities &amp;lhook;, &amp;eth; and &amp;vv; respectively. In the diplomatic files, they are represented more or less in the form they are found in the original. For indexing purposes, they are replaced with their modern equivalents. Note that the text also contains the Greek letters alpha and omega, represented here as character entities (&amp;agr; and &amp;ohgr;).</p><p>Note that line breaks are not recorded in the transcription, except in the 'argument' (preface) to the book, and in a few other cases where they were necessary for technical reasons.</p><h6 align="right">&copy; University of Cambridge 2004
