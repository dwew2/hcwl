They are found in a bundle of papers in NLW 2722E. All items were acquired by the National Library of Wales from the library of Edward Griffith, Coedcymer, Dolgellau, (1832-1918) in 1918.</p><h3>The source</h3><p>The letters are all copies of originals. The date of copying cannot be established. Four of them are explicitly identified as such, and the other (letter 2) is partially paraphrased in English in the third person (for instance <span class="cited_text">He writes thus to his wife...</span> (1.6)). The letters are mostly in Welsh. However, letter 2 seems to partly a paraphrase, partly a translation, and partly a copy of a letter that was perhaps written originally entirely in Welsh. The copyist seems to have begun (up to 1.16) trying to paraphrase the letter (cf. the quotation above), increasingly translates it directly as he or she proceeds. From 1.24-36, 2.1-5, and 2.10-3.29, the text seems to be essentially a translation in the first person. From 2.4-5, Welsh phrases and sentences are interspersed where they posed translation difficulties, either as glosses on the English (for instance, 3.11 <span class="cited_text">clear their ground (arloesi'r tir)</span>, or 3.14 <span class="cited_text">blackish (go ddu)</span>), or instead of the English (for instance, 3.18&#8211;19 <span class="cited_text">sudd yn crafu'r cwbwl fel yngymru</span>. At one point (3.3), the copyist deletes some Welsh <span class="cited_text">Mae'r Cyffyla</span>, apparently copied in error, and follows it with an English translation <span class="cited_text">The Horses eats</span>. From 3.29, the copyist appears largely to have given up on translation, and largely copies in Welsh, with occasional returns to translation or paraphrase. Dodd (page 45) states that &#8216;there are indications that the original was mostly if not entirely in Welsh, which the transcriber has translated, and in some parts paraphrased&#8217;. This seems to be correct, and is preferable to Conway's comment (page 327) that &#8216;the writer was semi-literate in both Welsh and English&#8217;, implying that the mix of languages is original. The English passages are marked off with seg-elements (&lt;seg lang="eng"&gt; ... &lt;/seg&gt;), and have been ignored in concordances.</p><p>The letters are numbered using the same system as adopted in Dodd's summary and translation of them (see below). The first two letters have been given individual page numbers, beginning at 1 in each case. Letters 3, 4 and 5 are copied together in a single booklet in the same hand and follow at single pagination in the original, with the pages of letter 3 being numbered 1-4, and the pages of letter 4 being numbered 5-6. This pagination has been followed in the transcription.</p><h3>The language and orthography of the text</h3><p>The letters are written in an orthography that departs significantly from the standard, reflecting a large number of features of the spoken language of Meirionydd. Noticeable linguistic features include:

<ul>
<li>reduction of immediately pretonic vowels to schwa, written &lt;y&gt; (e.g. <span class="cited_text">Gyffylau</span> for <span class="cited_text">geffylau</span> (5.7.36) etc.) or zero word-initially (<span class="cited_text">menun</span> for <span class="cited_text">ymenyn</span> (1.1.47)) (not tagged)</li>
<li>orthographic confusion of &lt;u&gt; and &lt;y&gt;</li>
<li>plural of nouns in -<span class="cited_text">a</span> (for instance, <span class="cited_text">Cyfreithia</span> (1.2.4)) (not tagged)</li>
<li>various spoken verbal forms</li>
<li>use of <span class="cited_text">mi</span> as an affirmative particle before verbs of all person-number combinations, including forms of the verb <span class="cited_text">bod</span></li>
</ul></p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3><p>Single underlining in letter 1 has not been transcribed. In letter 1, English glosses are written above various Welsh words; these have been encoded using the gloss-element. Letter 1 also uses &lt;.r.&gt; for modern Welsh &lt;yr&gt;. This has been encoded as a character entity .r., replaced by &lt;yr&gt; for indexing purposes. Marginal notes in English in letters 3-5 (mostly English summaries of the Welsh) have also been omitted.</p><h3>Further details</h3><p>The letters have been dealt with twice before, once by Arthur H. Dodd (&#8216;Letters from Welsh settlers in New York State 1816-1844&#8217;, <span class="title">National Library of Wales Journal</span> 9 (1955): 43&#8211;59), who provides an introduction and a partial translation and summary of the letters; and by Alan Conway (<span class="title">The Welsh in America: Letters from the immigrants</span> (Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1961), who offers a translation of all of the letters into English. Neither provides a Welsh text.</p><h6 align="right">&copy; University of Cambridge 2004
