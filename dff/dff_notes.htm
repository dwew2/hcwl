<h3>The text</h3><p>The text is a translation from English of John Mirk's <span class="title">Festial</span>, a collection of sermons written in the late 1380s. Mirk's text was widely disseminated in a new recension in England in the fifteenth century, a version being printed by Caxton in 1483. A further twenty-two editions were published between 1486 and 1532 (see Susan, Powell, 'Mirk, John (<i>fl. c.</i> 1382&#8211;<i>c.</i> 1414)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004)). The Welsh is a translation of 14 of the 74 homilies it contains, probably from one of the printed editions, although it does not bear a close resemblance to Caxton's. Lewis suggests that the manuscript is not a copy, and shows direct evidence of ongoing translation. The corpus transcription consists of an extract from the beginning of the text, pages 80&#8211;155, amounting to around two-thirds of the total.</p><h3>The source</h3><p>Hafod 22 also contains parts of the Gospels written by the same scribe, edited by Henry Lewis and published as &#8216;Darnau o'r Efengylau&#8217; <span class="title">Y Cymmrodor</span> 31 (1921): 193-216. For further details of the manuscript, see Lewis's editions of the two texts.</p><h3>The language and orthography of the text</h3><p>The text shows a considerable number of southern dialect features.</p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3><p>The scribe uses a double &lt;r&gt; with descenders below the line (each distinct from single &lt;r&gt;). It is possible that this is an (inconsistent) attempt to represent Welsh voiceless /r/ by a scribe whose dialect did not make the distinction. In any case, the double &lt;r&gt; tends to represent voiceless /r/, and voiceless /r/ tends to be represented using this character; however, this usage is far from consistent. The double &lt;r&gt; is represented in the transcription using the character entity &amp;rr;. Two diplomatic output files have been provided, one with simple &lt;r&gt; and one maintaining a distinct form (&lt;<span style="font-family: Arial Unicode MS">&#636;&#636;</span>&gt;); and in the concordance files it is replaced by &lt;rh&gt;. A third &lt;r&gt; resembling an upper-case &lt;R&gt; is also used occasionally, and is represented as &lt;R&gt;. On a few occasions, entirely in rubrics, the form of &lt;w&gt; resembling a &lt;6&gt; has been used. This is transcribed using the character entity &amp;v6;, and replaced by a &lt;w&gt; in the output files. The scribe leaves gaps at various points for titles etc. (for full details of the likely content of these gaps, see Lewis's edition). These are marked in the transcription using underscores.</p><h3>Further details</h3><p>The previous edition of the text is: Henry Lewis, <span class="title">Darn o'r Ffestifal (Liber Festialis): Allan o lawysgrif Havod 22, td. 80-195, gyda rhagymadrodd a nodiadau</span> (London: Cymdeithas y Cymmrodorion, 1925).
