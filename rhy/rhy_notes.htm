</h2><p>&#8216;Rhyfeddode'r Ynys&#8217;, Peniarth 163 ii (1543), 1-55.
</p><h3>The text</h3><p>The text is transcribed from Peniarth 163 ii (1543), 1-55, in the hand of Gruffudd Hiraethog. It can also be found in Peniarth 147 (c. 1566) and Peniarth 168 (1589; &#8216;Cronicl Hywel&#8217;; a copy of this can be found in Peniarth 215). Whereas Peniarth 147 seems either to be a copy of Peniarth 163 ii or to be based on the same exemplar (we have not seen the text, but according to <span class="title">Report on Manuscripts in the Welsh Language</span> i.921 the first chapter is missing as in Peniarth 163 ii and the same texts as in Peniarth 163 ii follow), Peniarth 168 is clearly an independent copy.</p><p>The text is based on Ranulph Higden's <span class="title">Polychronicon</span>, book 1, chapters 39-60 (ii.4-174 in Babington &amp; Lumby's edition: <span class="title">Polychronicon Ranulphi Higden Monachi Cestrensis; together with the English translations of John Trevisa and of an unknown writer of the fifteenth century</span>, edited by Churchill Babington and Joseph Rawson Lumby (London, 1865; reprinted Nendeln/Liechtenstein: Kraus Reprint, 1975)), incorporating material from chapter 38 (a description of Wales in verse, i.394-430 in Babington &amp; Lumby's edition) and with further additions towards the end of the text.</p><p>The text does not have a title in Peniarth 163 ii. The title &#8216;Rhyfeddode'r Ynys&#8217;, taken from the <span class="title">Report on manuscripts in the Welsh language</span> and the heading on page 4 of the manuscript, has been chosen for convenience; &#8216;Disgrifiad Ynys Prydain&#8217; or the like may in fact be more appropriate.</p><h3>The source</h3><p>The first folio of the manuscript with the first chapter of the text seems to have been lost. The gap has been filled in the transcription from Peniarth 168, 1r-2r. The extent of the text in Peniarth 168 equals about two pages in Peniarth 163 ii. The pagination of the transcription of Peniarth 163 ii nevertheless starts at "1". The first surviving page is slightly rubbed away but is readable.</p><p>Between what is now pages 16 and 21 two smaller leaves have been inserted, now paginated 17-20, which contain what seem to be notes by Gruffudd Hiraethog. These have been moved to the end of the transcription so as to not
interrupt the flow of the text at this point.</p><p>The scribe's colophon in Peniarth 168, 31r reads &#8216;Finito libro sit laus et gloria Christo. Qui leget emendet scriptorem non reprehendet./ Qd [?] Syr John Powys Anno Domini 1514./ descript. 1589. Mense Decembri&#8217;, which points to the translation having been made in or before 1514.</p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3>
<p>The scribe uses two different &lt;v&gt;s, one with a loop, mostly or exclusively representing a vowel, and one with a straight left stroke, predominantly representing a consonant. The former has therefore been transcribed as &lt;u&gt;, the latter as &lt;v&gt;. Articles, preverbal particles, prepositions etc. have always been separated from the following word. Sections with headings are marked up using div-elements.</p>
<p>In the manuscript, the text is divided into segments using segment marks. These are encoded as &lt;p&gt; tags in the transcription, and the segments appear as separate paragraphs in the display files.</p>
