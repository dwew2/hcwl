	</p><p>Broadly chronological: Bishops' wars, Charles's agreement with Parliament (Pym), execution of Earl of Strafford.</p><h3>The source</h3><p>Various errors, particularly in the reproduction of names, indicate that the text is a copy. For instance, the form of the name of Chaloner as &lt;Chalwer&gt; on page 33 suggests a misreading of &lt;on&gt; as &lt;w&gt;; the text on page suggests a misunderstanding or misreading of <span class="cited_text">ysgafell</span> 'scaffold' as <span class="cited_text">ystafell</span> 'room'. The corrections <span class="cited_text">nghneifio</span> for <span class="cited_text">mling</span> on page 45 (line 1221) and <span class="cited_text">nodedig</span> for <span class="cited_text">caredig</span> on page 62 (line 1721) suggest eye-skip errors during copying. The metre indicates that a line of text has been omitted with no indication at one point, further evidence of copying. This line has been numbered 1109 in the transcription, and left blank. The copyist appears to have confused the characters of the Earl of Essex and the Sequestrator, presumably through misinterpreting &lt;Esex&gt; in his original as an abbreviation for <span class="cited_text">Esexquestrator</span>, the form used throughout for Sequestrator. In the transcription corrections (corr-tags) have been added to restore the distinction.</p><h3>The language and orthography of the text</h3><p>A number of linguistic and orthographic features are noteworthy:
	<ul>
	<li>loss of immediately pretonic vowels (e.g. <span class="cited_text">clomennod</span> (1523)) (generally tagged)</li>
	<li>reduction of first person singular present ending and pronoun -<span class="cited_text">af i</span> to -<span class="cited_text">ai</span> (not tagged)</li>
	<li>the first person singular present ending -<span class="cited_text">e</span> is also found (for instance, <span class="cited_text">wele</span> (line 1672)) (tagged)</li>
	<li>reduction of first person singular prefixed genitive pronoun (<span class="cited_text">fy</span>) to <span class="cited_text">y</span> or zero (with retention of nasal mutation as the marker of person) (mostly tagged)</li>

	</p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3><p>The manuscript has been corrected and added to in various places by a second hand. The two hands found in the manuscript are identified, where necessary, using resp-attributes, the main scribe (hand 1) as "hd1", and the second hand (hand 2) as "hd2". The emendations of the second hand have been marked up in two different ways: where the emendations seem to be correct, the original text is marked up with a corr-element, with the original reading as a sic-attribute (that is, &lt;corr sic="hand 1's text" resp="hd2"&gt;hand 2's emendation&lt;/corr&gt;); where these corrections do not seem to be justified, the original is marked up with a sic-element, with hand 2's emendation as a corr-attribute (that is, &lt;sic corr="hand 2's emendation" resp="hd2"&gt;hand 1's text&lt;/sic&gt;).</p><p>Editorial punctuation has been added throughout and capitalisation has been adjusted accordingly. Speaker headings and stage directions are in the left margin throughout, and this has not been tagged separately in each case. They have generally been placed at the end of the speech to which they relate.</p><p>Line groups are identified either as couplets or quatrains using the type-attribute of the lg-element (possible values "couplet", "quatrain", or "unknown").</p><p>On page 6, a gap is left, with a speaker heading in the margin, approximately the size of a stanza. The lines of the gap have been numbered 139-42 in the diplomatic version and concordance. Another two lines, numbered 195-6, have been left blank in the same way pn page 7.</p><p>It has been assumed that the maid (<span class="cited_text">y forwyn</span>) who appears on page 16 is the same character as the Queen's handmaid (<span class="cited_text">y llawforwyn</span>) on pages 23-4.</p><p>Note that the text includes square brackets from the original at one point (line 1572).</p><h3>Further details</h3><p>Details of the historical figures are taken from the online Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (http://www.oxforddnb.com).</p>
