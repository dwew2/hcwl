Hopkin James and T. C. Evans in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau, carolau, a chywyddau being sermons in song in the Gwentian dialect by forty-two bards of Tir Iarll of the Tudor period</span> (Bangor: Jarvis &amp; Foster, 1910) (= <span class="title">HG</span>). The poems by Tomas in that edition are all from NLW 13070B. This electronic edition contains five additional poems that are attributed to Tomas in the manuscripts, but which were omitted in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span>, two from Cardiff Free Library 2.619 and three from NLW 13081B. Details of the three manuscript sources are given below.</p><h3>The source</h3><p>1. <b>NLW 13070B</b> (Llanover B.9). Poems by Tomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys are on pages 1-41, 166-168, according to the new pagination. The manuscript is described as follows in the <span class="title">Handlist of manuscripts in the National Library of Wales</span>, vol. iv:

<p>HEN GWNDIDAU, &amp;c</p>
<p>An imperfect manuscript consisting of one hundred and forty-one folios and twenty-six fragments repaired and rebound in half vellum, the fragments being tipped in on blank leaves at the end of the volume. Of the original manuscript thirty-two folios at the beginning (as per a previous foliation ) ? containing poems numbered 1-28 and part of poem 29, numerous mid-volume folios, and an indeterminate number of folios at the end appear to have been lost. The volume has been repaginated 1-344 [...]. Pp. 1-178 (excepting p. 176 and later insertions) are in the hand of the Glamorgan poet and copyist Llywelyn Si&ocirc;n (1540-?1615), the scribe of N.L.W. MSS. 970, 6511, and 13075-6 (see <i>TLLM.</i> [= Griffith John Williams, <span class="title">Traddodiad llenyddol Morgannwg</span>, (Cardiff: Gwasg Prifysgol Cymru, 1948)], tt. 157-60). The greater part of the remainder of the volume appears to be in a later seventeenth century hand or hands. The contents consist of transcripts of Welsh poems in free and strict metres, the free-metre verse being largely in the form of 'cwndidau' (see <span class="title">TLLM.</span>, tt. 120-43). Included is a corpus of poems by the sixteenth century Glamorgan poets Thomas ap Ieuan ap Rys (25) and Hopgin Thom[as] Phylip (22). Other poets whose works are transcribed include Thomas ap Ieuan ap Madog [...]. The poems by Hopkin Thomas Philip have been published in Lemuel James: <span class="title">Hopkiniaid Morgannwg ...</span> (Bangor, 1909), and a large proportion of the remaining poems in L. J. Hopkin James and T. C. Evans: <span class="title">Hen Gwndidau, Carolau, a Chywyddau ...</span> (Bangor, 1910). [...]</p>
<p><i>Welsh; English.</i> Late XVI-XVIII cent.</p>

</p><p>2. <b>Cardiff Free Library 2.619</b> (Havod 5). The poems used in this edition are found on pages 21-24 and 30-36. The manuscript is described as followis in the <span class="title">Report on Manuscripts in the Welsh Language</span> ii.i, 246:

<p><span style="font-variant:small-caps">Poetry, Prophecies,</span> and <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Triads</span>, written mostly [...] in a hand dated 1586 (see page 233). Paper; 8x6 inches; pp. 1a-260; bound in paper boards.</p>

</p><p>3. <b>NLW 13081B</b> (Llanover B.23). The poems used in this edition are found on folios 125v-132r, 133v-134r, 135v-136v, 156v-158r, 160v-165v, 173v-175r, 182r-183v and 186r-187v. The manuscript is described as follows in the <span class="title">Handlist of manuscripts in the National Library of Wales</span> iv:

<p>BARDDONIAETH, &amp;c</p>
<p>A slightly imperfect manuscript consisting of one hundred and ninety-nine folios rebound in full leather. The contents consist mainly of transcripts of Welsh strict- and free-metre poems including poems by, or attributed to, [...] Thomas ap Ieuan ap Rhys, [...] The greater part of the volume is written in a number of artificial or contrived copying hands, the scribe in some instances appearing to simulate a gothic script. The initial capitals of some of the poems have elaborate decorative detail sometimes incorporating the outlines of human figures or faces, the latter mostly grotesques. The volume has been attributed to a Glamorgan or Gwentian copyist of the first half of the seventeenth century (see <i>TLLM.</i>, t. 44). If this dating is accepted, stanzas such as those by Rhys Prichard probably have to be regarded as later insertions. [...]</p>
<p><i>Welsh; English.</i> XVII-XIX cent.</p>

</p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3><p>The first twenty-five poems in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> are from NLW 13070B (Llanover B.9), in the order in which they occur in the manuscript; poem 25 follows the others at a considerable distance. The beginning of the first poem is missing in the manuscript, the missing text is supplied from NLW 13081B (Llanover B. 23). All poems are explicitly attributed to Tomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys. The colophons include a running number that counts <i>all</i> poems in the manuscript, not only those by Tomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys.</p><p>These are followed by one poem from Cardiff Free Library 2.619 (Havod 5) (<span class="title">HG</span> No. 26). The manuscript contains seven other poems attributed to Tomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys, five of which had already been edited from NLW 13070B (<span class="title">HG</span> Nos. 6, 12, 14, 15, 18); two poems (manuscript pp. 30-32, 32-36) were omitted in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span>. In addition, the manuscript, on page 246, contains a fragment of a poem attributed to Tomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys in what appears to be the same hand as that of NLW 13070B.</p><p>The next portion of poems (<span class="title">HG</span> Nos. 27-35) is taken from NLW 13081B (Llanover B. 23). Only one of these is explicitly attributed to Tomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys in the manuscript (No. 27); the other eight are without attribution, whether in this manuscript, in NLW 13070B, or in Cardiff Free Library 2.619, and possibly in later manuscripts too. However, most of them do occur in a sequence of poems many of which are attributed to Thomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys, if not in NLW 13081B itself then at least in one of the other, earlier manuscripts. It is for this reason that they are included here. On the other hand, three poems <i>with</i> attribution to Thomas ab Ieuan ap Rhys (and, at least in NLW 13070B and Cardiff Free Library 2.619, to no other poet) were omitted in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> (manuscript folios 160v-162v, 162v-164r and 164v-165v). The poems in the edition do not appear in the order of the manuscript, which would be Nos. 29-33, 27-28, 34-35 (these do not necessarily constitute uninterrupted sequences of poems). Poems from other later manuscripts follow.</p><p>The current edition contains only poems from the three manuscripts mentioned, NLW 13070B, Cardiff Free Library MS 2.619, and NLW 13081B. It follows <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> in placing those from <b>NLW 13070B</b> first (our nos. 1-25), with the missing text of the first poem being supplied from NLW 13081B. Those poems in <b>Cardiff Free Library 2.619</b> not already edited from NLW 13070B follow (our nos. 26-28, of which 27-28 were omitted in <span class="title">HG</span>). As regards the material from <b>NLW 13081B</b>, poems with attribution are given first, in the order of the manuscript (our nos. 29-32, of which 30-32 were omitted in <span class="title">HG</span>), and of the remaining unattributed poems included here are only those also published in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span>, again in the order of the manuscript (our nos. 33-40).</p><p>The numbering of the poems in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> and this edition is thus identical up to and including no. 26.</p><p><span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> is a diplomatic edition and differences between this edition and ours, apart from mistakes in the one or the other, are relatively few:
<ul>
<li>The editors of <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> transcribe the manuscripts' letter &lt;v&gt; as &lt;v&gt; when it represents a consonant, but as &lt;u&gt; when it represents a vowel. All &lt;v&gt;s are transcribed as &lt;v&gt;s here, irrespective of phonetic value. In NLW 13070B and in Cardiff Free Library 2.619, all &lt;u&gt;s bear a diaeresis (&uuml;). Since the diacritic is redundant, it is omitted here, and all &lt;&uuml;&gt;s of the manuscripts are transcribed as &lt;u&gt;, unlike in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span>, which uses &lt;&uuml;&gt;. Thus, &lt;u&gt; in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> (where it is not a mistake) corresponds to our &lt;v&gt;; and &lt;&uuml;&gt; in <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> corresponds to our &lt;u&gt;.</li>

<li>In NLW 13070B and Cardiff Free Library 2.619, stanzas are (not always correctly) numbered. NLW 13081B does not have stanza numbers. In <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> these numbers are supplied, in our edition they are not.</li>

<li><span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> often provides variants from a manuscript other than the main one. Following our general policy to edit only one manuscript where several exist, we do not. However, damaged text has been supplied from other manuscripts, and where the main manuscript seems to show a crass mistake, we have corrected the text (using corr-elements, and therefore recording the original reading) according to one of the other manuscripts. This has hardly ever been necessary. In fact, in a few instances, the editors of <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> seem to have preferred the reading of one of the other manuscripts where it is not necessarily better (for example, in 8:61, the editors of <span class="title">HG</span> follow NLW 13081B, <span class="cited_text">er y tristyd</span> in preference to the not obviously worse <span class="cited_text">er i thristyd</span> in NLW 13070B). Generally, we have been more reluctant to supply text in cases where <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> does. Thus, in 26:63 <span class="cited_text">rrag yddo ladd</span> (from Cardiff Free Library 2.619), <span class="title">Hen gwndidau</span> supplies <span class="cited_text">ef</span> after <span class="cited_text">yddo</span> from NLW 13081B, which has here been omitted.</li>
