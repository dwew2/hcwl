Five letters were sent to Theophilus Rees at the Cambria Settlement, Beulah, Pennsylvania, mostly by Samuel Thomas of Carllegan, [parish of Mydrim, co. Carmarthen], the other correspondents being John and Ann Thomas at London, and a sixth letter from John D. Evans at Beulah writing to Theophilus Rees in Seiotha, Ohio. There is also a letter to David R. Thomas of Granville, Ohio, from D. Thomas at Swansea, as well as biographical details concerning Theophilus Rees and his family.</p><p>All the letters in Welsh are transcribed here. The letter from John and Ann Thomas, dated 20 June 1801, and another undated letter in the same hand, are in English, and are not transcribed. The letter from D. Thomas to David Thomas of Granville, OH, dated 14 April 1832, is also in English, and has not been transcribed.</p><p>The letters by Samuel Thomas all appear to be originals in his own hand, and contain consistent idiosyncrasies of spelling. Most notable is the use of &lt;c&gt; instead of &lt;g&gt;. The letter by Moses David also appears to be original, although it would seem that he had it written for him by William Richard, who then added his own short letter at the end. The letter by John D. Evans also appears to be original. Some bibliographical notes in another, presumably later hand have also been transcribed for information, along with some other additions.</p><h3>The language and orthography of the text</h3><p>The letters contain extensive features of Carmarthenshire dialect.</p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3><p></p>
