<h2>How to use the system</h2>
<hr>
<H3>Using Frames - the parts of the window</H3>
Your browser's window is divided into five regions called frames.
All the frames can be re-sized: if you let the cursor hover exactly on
the border between two frames, it will change to a re-sizing cursor
which you can drag to reposition the border. You could enlarge this frame
now to make this Help page easier to read.
<p>


<blockquote>
<h3>What the Frames do:</h3>
At the top right of the browser window is the Text Frame,
which displays the original text of the work you have chosen to explore.
You can use the scroll bars to move around in the text.  Clicking on a
Reference in the Concordance frame will make the Text Frame scroll
automatically to display the relevant part of the source text.
<p>

To the left of the Text Frame is the Wordlist Frame, containing an
alphabetic list of all words which are used in the source text.
Clicking on a Headword in the Wordlist Frame will make the Concordance
Frame scroll automatically to display all the instances of that Headword,
together with a line of context for each.
<p>
You are (probably!) reading this in the Concordance Frame.  When
not displaying this help, it displays the Concordance.  If you
have clicked on a Headword in the Wordlist Frame, the Concordance
Frame will have scrolled automatically to that Headword.
Beside each Headword is a count of the number of times it occurs,
and below it are all the actual occurrences, each in a line of context.
To the right of each context line are References. Clicking on a Reference
will make the Text Frame scroll automatically to display the
relevant part of the source text.
<p>

The frames down the left edge of the browser's window are the
Alphabetic Navigators.  They provide a quick way of controlling the
frames to their right, so the upper one controls the Wordlist Frame
and the lower one controls the Concordance Frame.  Click on a letter
in an Alphabetic Navigator to go quickly to the words beginning with
that letter.  If a letter of the alphabet is missing from a Navigator,
that is because the original text contains no words beginning with
that letter.  If you have chosen to sort your wordlist by frequency instead of alphabetically, the Wordlist Navigator contains links to words which occur with a particular frequency instead of words which begin with a particular letter.<P>

<h2>Hints: how to get more text on screen at a time</h2>
A Web Concordance puts a lot of text onto the screen. You may find yourself wishing
you could see more text at once and had to scroll around less.
<p>
There are several ways to improve things:
<ul>
<li> Turn off the bits of your browser which you don't need.  Unnecessary toolbars and buttons
use screen space.
<li>Choose a smaller font.
<li> Re-size the frames so that the one you want to see more of is larger. All the
frames can be re-sized: if you let the cursor hover exactly on the border between two
frames, it will change to a re-sizing cursor which you can drag to reposition the border.
</ul>

<a name="search"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Searching for a word</h2>
The Alphabetical Navigators in the left-hand frames are quick ways of
scrolling the Wordlist frame and the Concordance frame to words beginning
with the letter you want.  From there you can browse, using the frame's scroll
bars, to find the word you want.  (If you have chosen to sort your wordlist by frequency instead of alphabetically, the Wordlist Navigator contains links to words which occur with a particular frequency instead of words which begin with a particular letter.)


<p>
You can also use your browser's Find button to carry out any search.
The search will happen in the frame you last clicked in.  To let the system
find a word for you in a single operation, first load the entire Wordlist
(see <a href="#morecontrols">More Wordlist controls</a>), then press
the Find button.

The Find button will also work for searches in the Text Frame and the
Concordance Frame, but bear in mind that only one section of the Text or
the Concordance will be loaded at any one time, so searches with the Find
button will be confined to that section.<p>

<H2>More Wordlist controls</H2>
At the top of the Wordlist you will see either the
<IMG align=middle width=53 height=25 SRC="tslink3.gif"> button or the
<IMG align=middle width=57 height=25 SRC="tszig3.gif"> button.  They are opposites in
their effect. <p>

<IMG align=left width=53 height=25 SRC="tslink3.gif"> This button appears at the top of a
section of the Wordlist when only one section of the Wordlist is loaded.
Pressing it will cause the entire Wordlist to be loaded at once.
Loading the entire Wordlist makes searching easier, since searches
are otherwise confined to the loaded portion; but it will probably slow
down other aspects of your browser's performance.
<p>

<IMG align=left width=57 height=25 SRC="tszig3.gif"> This button appears at the top of a
section of the Wordlist when the entire Wordlist is already loaded.
Pressing it will cause a single section of the Wordlist to be loaded
instead.  Loading the Wordlist a section at a time will speed up most aspects
of your browser's performance, but will mean that searches for words
in the wordlist will be confined to the loaded portion.

When you have finished with this help, you can reload the concordance into
this frame by clicking on any letter in the Concordance Alphabetic Navigator
or any Headword in the Wordlist.
