</h2><p>Ystor&iuml;au allan o NLW ms. 13075B (=Llanover B17) (ms. c. 1590 (composed before 1561)), 52r-54v (&#8216;Hanes Taliesin&#8217; / &#8216;Llyma val i kavad Taliesin&#8217;), 54v-58r (&#8216;Ystori y g&#373;r moel o Sythia&#8217;, 69r-84v (&#8216;Ystori Alexander a Lodwig&#8217;), 104v-106v (&#8216;Ystori'r llong foel&#8217;)).
</p><h3>The text</h3><p> 
&#8216;Ystori y g&#373;r moel o Sythia&#8217;: The text is an account of the advice of a Scythian to Alexander the Great, telling him of the folly of attacking Scythia. It appears in Quintus Curtius's <span class="title">Historiae Alexandri Magni</span> from where it was taken up in the <span class="title">Alexandreis</span> of Walter of Ch&acirc;tillon-sur-Marne (Galterus de Castellione), written sometime between 1176 and 1202. Latin editions of this text were printed in <i>c.</i> 1487, 1513, 1541, and 1558. The Welsh text is a translation of part of Walter's text, either directly from the Latin, or via English or French. It is found in full in Welsh in two manuscripts: NLW ms. 13075B (=Llanover B17) and the damaged Cardiff Free Library 2.621 (Havod 8). Part of the text, probably copied from NLW 13075B, is also found in British Library Add. 14880. All manuscripts represent a single translation into Welsh, probably made in south Wales some time before 1561.</p><p>&#8216;Ystori Alexander a Lodwig&#8217;: The text is a version of one of the tales from the <span class="title">Historia Septem Sapientum Romae</span> (Chwedlau Saith Doethion Rhufain). It uses the &#8216;Vaticinium&#8217; motif, namely the motif of the prophecy that the parents will humble themselves before their son. The tale appears frequently in medieval and early modern Welsh literature. The text here is a free translation from a sixteenth-century English version, similar to that published by Wynkyn de Worde in London around 1510-15, and in various other editions in the sixteenth century.</p><h3>The source</h3><p>The texts are transcribed from National Library of Wales ms. 13075B (=Llanover B17). The manuscript is in the hand of Llywelyn Si&ocirc;n (1540-?1615) of Llangewydd, Glamorgan, and was copied at some time between 1585 and 1590. As well as the tales transcribed in the corpus, the manuscript also contains other tales from &#8216;Ystori Saith Doethion Rhufain&#8217;, edited by Henry Lewis in <span class="title">Revue Celtique</span> 46: 54-83.</p><h3>The language and orthography of the text</h3><p>The following linguistic and orthographic features are worthy of note:

<ul><li>extensive confusion of &lt;u&gt;, &lt;y&gt; and &lt;i&gt; (for instance, <span class="cited_text">tia</span> (HT 53r.14, YAL 77r.1, 82v.17), both <span class="cited_text">bv</span> (HT 53r.5, YAL 73v.25 etc.) and <span class="cited_text">by</span> (YAL 69v.9, 106r.23)) suggests a southern system of high vowels with complete merger of Middle Welsh <span class="IPA">/&#616;/</span>, <span class="IPA">/&#649;/</span> and /i/.</li>
<li>&lt;ai&gt; is used in most cases to represent both modern Welsh &lt;ei&gt; and modern Welsh &lt;ai&gt;(not tagged)</li>
<li>the southern form <span class="cited_text">yddy</span> is frequently used in YAL (but not in the other texts) for modern Welsh <span class="cited_text">i'w</span> (preposition + infixed genitive pronoun) (tagged on first occurrence only)</li></ul></p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3>The manuscript uses &lt;&uuml;&gt; and a dotted &lt;y&gt;. These are rendered in the transcription as &lt;u&gt; and &lt;y&gt; respectively. Umlauted &lt;&uuml;&gt; is the normal form of &lt;u&gt;, and, with occasional exceptions, &lt;u&gt; is not found without an umlaut. Two forms of &lt;r&gt; are found in the manuscript: &lt;R&gt; is found word-initially, and &lt;r&gt; is found word-internally. The difference does not reflect the difference between voiceless and voiced (mutated) /r/. Both have therefore been rendered as &lt;r&gt; in the transcription.<h3>Further details</h3><p>For further details, see the editions:
