</h2><p>Ifan Llwyd ap Dafydd (died c. 1607&#8211;9). &#8216;Ystorie Kymru&#8217;, National Library of Wales Add. ms. 13B ((composed) 1567-1609 (ms. early seventeenth century)), 198r-237r.
</p><h3>The text</h3><p>The text can be found in two other manuscripts, namely, Llanstephan 129, 1-60 (first half of the seventeenth century); and Llanstephan 60, 1-144 (seventeenth and eighteenth centuries).</p><p>The text was edited, from Llanstephan 129, with variants from the other manuscripts, by Nia Lewis (Astudiaeth destunol a beirniadol o &#8216;Ystorie Kymru neu Cronigl Kymraeg&#8217; (Ifan Llwyd ap Dafydd) (MA dissertation, University of Wales, 1967)).</p><p>Lewis (1967: xc) notes that the text uses Richard Davies&#8217;s <span class="title">Epistol at y Cembru</span> as a source, so its date of composition must be later than 1567.</p><h3>The source</h3><p>The text is from National Library of Wales Add. ms. 13B, 1-298 (early seventeenth century) in the hand of Morgan ap Hwmphrey. This is the earliest of the extant manuscipt copies of the text. The full text of the work runs from folios 1 to 298. The corpus contains a selection from folios 92v-141r. Between folio 128 and folio 129 one leaf is missing, the text has been supplied from Llanstephan 129, 44v-45r.</p><p>The text in NLW Add. 13B is faint or damaged in many places; where the reading of the manuscript was doubtful or text had to be supplied, Lewis's edition  was consulted. The supplied text from Llanstephan 129 was transcribed directly from a microfilm of the manuscript in the National Library of Wales, and may differ slightly from Lewis's edition, especially in punctuation, word spacing and capitalisation, which represent those of the manuscript. The linebreaks are those of the manuscript.</p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3>
