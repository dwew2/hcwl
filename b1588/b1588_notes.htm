<h3>The text</h3><p>The corpus contains four extracts from different parts of the 1588 Bible, two from the Old Testament (Genesis 37, 39-41, recounting part of the story of Joseph; and I Samuel 16-20, recounting part of the story of David); and two from the New Testament (Matthew 26-28, the Passion and Resurrection; and II Corinthians 1-9).</p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3><p>The original text is arranged in two columns, and numbered by folio rather than by page. References here are therefore of the type 17v.b for the second column of folio 17 verso. The division of the text into chapter and verse is marked up using div-elements (e.g. &lt;div type="verse" n="7"&gt; ... &lt;/div&gt; for verse 7). Chapter headings are recorded as they are in the original, but verse numbers are not recorded separately from the div-elements. In the original, the first verse of a chapter is always left unmarked, the remainder are numbered using ordinary Arabic numerals. Quotations and direct speech have been marked up using q-elements; they are not usually marked explicitly in the original. Note that the original contains some square brackets.</p><p>In the original, folio 120 is incorrectly numbered 119. This has been silently corrected in the transcription.</p><h6 align="right"><span class="cym">Diweddarwyd: 2 Tachwedd 2004</span><br><span class="eng">Last update: 2 November 2004</span></h6></body></html>
