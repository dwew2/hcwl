<h3>The source</h3><p>The manuscript is in the hand of John Jones of
					Gellilyfdy. Pages 1-119 were written early in 1613 according to a note at the bottom
					of page 119: Ac fal hynn y terfyna y rann yma or llyfr hwnn die
					merchhur y /14:/ dydd o fis Cwefror [sic] yn y vlwyddy
					[sic] o oedran Krist /1613/. A piece of text is omitted on page 17, with a scribal note
					referring the reader to page 37, where the missing text is reproduced. The text has been
					moved to its logical position in the transcription, but with pagination maintained as in
					the original. Page 59 contains only a large letter &lt;A&gt;, and page 60 is left
					blank, as are pages 79-88. From the top of page 136, the hand, ink and orthography
					changes. Dotted letters, which are used sporadically from the start of the note on page
					119 onwards, are used extensively from page 136. The latter part of the manuscript was
					written in 1622, according to a note on page 160: Ac fal hynn y terfyna y /4/ lyfr [sic]
					or hanes honn yr /11/ dydd o fis medi yn y vlwyddyn o oedran Krist /1622:/.</p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3><p>Up to page 39 of the manuscript, names and stage directions are written in red in a
					different script, with names underlined. These have been marked up in the transcription of
					the Preface with the hi-element, with rend-attributes "smallcaps" in the
					first instance, and " underlined in the second. Underlining, where it occurs, is
					noted elsewhere again by use of the hi-element with an "underlined"
					rend-attribute. Highlighting of names in red is not noted in the TEI-file otherwise. From
					page 40 up to page 113, gaps are left for names in the manuscript. In the transcription,
					the appropriate names have been supplied and marked with the supplied-element. The name
					Troelus has always been supplied in the form &lt;Troelus&gt;, except in one case
					(page 50) where the catchword on the previous page indicates that &lt;Troelws&gt;
					was intended. Dotted letters are used extensively in the latter part of the manuscript,
					namely dotted &lt;c C d D l p P r R t T u U&gt;. Dotted &lt;u U&gt;
					represents both the vowel /u/ and the consonant /w/ (both modern Welsh orthographic
					&lt;w&gt;). These are marked up using character entities (&amp;cd; etc.) in
					the TEI-file, and are replaced with their modern equivalents in the display files.</p><p>Note that speakers are not marked as a who-attribute of sp-elements. Where speakers are identified in the text, the name of the speaker is identified by a speaker-element; where speakers are not identified in the text, speaker names are supplied (within supplied- and speaker-elements). There is no supplied cast list.</p><h3>Further details</h3><p>A previous edition of the text was edited by W. Beynon Davies:
