</td></tr></table><h3>The source</h3><p>This selection contains copies of letters written by the poet Goronwy Owen (1723-1769) to William Morris, preserved in copies from two manuscripts, British Library Additional 15037 and National Library of Wales 17B. Only letters predominantly in Welsh or substantial parts of which are in Welsh and which are of some length and have not been preserved as an autograph elsewhere have been included. The letters date from the period  from 1752 to 1757. They were written mostly during Owen's time as a curate at Walton, near Liverpool, from 1753 to 1755, although some date from his time as a curate at Donnington, Shropshire (1748&#8211;53), or as a curate at Northolt, Middelsex, from 1755.</p><p>Regarding the origin of the two manuscripts, Davies writes (pages iii-iv):
[The letters addressed to William Morris] were in the year 1783, [sic] in the possession of Mrs. Jones of Summer Hill, Beaumaris, the only surviving child of William Morris. She died at the age of 84 in 1833. Owen Jones (O. Myfyr) arranged with Robert Hughes (Robyn Ddu o Fon) to make a copy of these letters in 1783. Hughes copied 27 letters in due course (purloining a part of one letter), and his copy is now in the British Museum (Addit. MS. 15037). Some time before 1789 a transcript was made by the Rev. David Ellis then Curate of Amlwch, afterwards of Criccieth, the well-known transcriber of Welsh manuscripts of all kinds. This manuscript is now in the National Library (Add. MSS. 17-B.).

</p><p>Pages 281-8 of NLW 17B have been misplaced between pages 272 and 273; there are two pages numbered 319 (the second of which has been numbered 319* here); page 328 is empty except for an address written on it and also misplaced since the relevant letter into which the page has been inserted continues on page 329.</p><h3>Previous editions</h3><p>All material has previously been edited by J. H. Davies, <span class="title">The letters of Goronwy Owen (1723&#8211;1769)</span> (Cardiff: William Lewis, 1924). In his edition, Davies states (page v) that "in printing these letters the Editor has been careful to preserve the orthography of the original letters" and that (page vi) "in the letters printed from transcripts, the Editor has followed the orthography of the transcript". This selection does not contain original letters, but as far as the transcripts are concerned, his assertion is true only to a certain degree. Although he has not modernised the spelling of words (apart from the use of diacritics), differences do exist, which often give the text of the printed edition a subtly different emphasis from that of the manuscript text. First, and perhaps most importantly, the editor basically ignores underlining in the texts, used, among other things, for emphasis. On the other hand, emphasis in the edited text (italicisation) sometimes has no equivalent in the manuscript. Second, the editor alters the manuscripts' punctuation, which is clearly consciously employed, thereby changing the rhythm and pacing of the text. And third, where in the manuscript text nouns and other words are capitalised, the editor generally decapitalises these, but selectively preserves the capitalisation, thereby giving the words in question a prominence in the edition they do not have in the original. The current edition does not follow these conventions.</p><h3>The language and orthography of the text</h3><p>Although Owen himself was a native of Anglesey, and was educated in Bangor, and, perhaps, Pwllheli, the letters are written in an eighteenth-century literary variety of Welsh, and contain little to betray the author's geographic origins.</p><h3>Details of the encoding</h3><p>Fairly extensive parts of some of the letters are in English. These passages are transcribed, but are marked as such, using seg-elements with the lang-attribute "en". Some (but not all) Latin quotations have been marked in the same way with the lang-attribute "la". In the main, only the letters themselves are transcribed; certain material in the manuscripts outside the letters, for instance, notes and summaries by the copyist, has (with a few exceptions) been omitted.</p><p>Eth occurs and is represented by the character entity &amp;eth;. Some of the letters contain square brackets, apparently for comments and additions by the copyist. Some additions in other hands are marked as "hd2".</p>
