</h2><p>Theophilus Evans (1693-1767). <span class="title">Drych y prif oesoedd</span> (Y Mwythig: gan John Rhydderch tros yr Awdur, 1716),
 64-102, 116-23, 230-49.
</p><h3>Y testun</h3><p>The text is divided into two parts, differing quite radically from one another. The corpus includes two extracts from the first, and one extract from the second part: the whole of part i., chapter 4, dealing with the arrival of the Saxons in Britain; the second half of part i., chapter 5, namely the part dealing with the Welsh language; and the whole of part ii., chapter 5, dealing with religious disputes surrounding the sacrament of baptism.</p><h3>Manylion yr amgodu</h3>The original contains numerous footnotes, marked by a lower-case italic letter in parentheses, followed by a comma, detailing soures. The content of these footnotes has been omitted in the transcription, but their position is marked in the XML-TEI file by a gap-element (&lt;gap desc="footnote"/&gt;). At several points (for instance, 75.18 88.24 and 237.2), where the footnote is the only content of a given line, omission of footnotes has lead to empty (but numbered) lines in the transcription, and the punctuation has been adjusted slightly as a result. A second set of explanatory footnotes and glosses is marked in the original using asterisks and various similar symbols. The content of these footnotes has also been omitted in the transcription, but their position is marked with the original symbol used. Authorial glosses, also marked in the original with asterisks, are included in the transcription, and marked up using the &lt;note&gt; element.The original uses italics for argument summaries and for poetry. These are marked up using the rend-attribute of the argument-element and lg-element respectively. Italics are maintained where found for individual words and phrases within the main body of the text. Caesuras in poetry (represented in the source by a gap) have been marked up using the &lt;caesura/&gt; element. Catchwords have also been omitted throughout. Note that the original contains square brackets in a number of places.<h3>Manylion pellach</h3><p>Golygwyd y testun mewn argraffiad eithaf dibynadwy gan Garfield H. Hughes:
