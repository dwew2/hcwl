</h2><p>'Y Brenin Llur', Cwrtmawr ms. 212 (1700-50), testun cyflawn / entire text.
</p><p>'Y Brenin Llur' is transcribed from Cwrtmawr ms. 212 in the National Library of Wales. The manuscript dates to the first half of the eighteenth century. In addition to 'Y Brenin Llur', it also includes four tribannau by John Hughes. It also bears the name of David Mor(r)is (Cwrtmawr catalogue, National Library of Wales). The manuscript is damaged and illegible in places, and pages 13-14 are almost entirely missing. There are some original corrections by the scribe. The manuscript is probably a copy of an earlier examplar, and shows some copying errors. For instance, a copying error on page 32 is corrected: <span class="cited_text">diogi</span>, which appears on the following line, was copied, and then deleted and replaced by <span class="cited_text">tylodi</span>.</p><p>The text clearly originates from North Wales, perhaps the Conwy or Clwyd valley. The evidence of placenames mentioned in the text, namely <span class="cited_text">caergybi</span> (6.9), <span class="cited_text">crygnant</span> (9.8), <span class="cited_text">traws fynudd</span> (9.11), <span class="cited_text">llandrillo</span> (9.16), and Anglesey (<span class="cited_text">oddyma i fon</span> (9.17)), points in this direction, as does dialect evidence.</p><p>The following orthographic and linguistic peculiarites are noteworthy:
<ul><li>extensive confusion of &lt;y&gt; and &lt;u&gt; and of &lt;u&gt; and &lt;i&gt; (not tagged)</li>
<li>modern Welsh <span class="IPA">/a&#618;/</span> is represented both by &lt;ai&gt; and &lt;ei&gt; (not tagged)</li>
<li>extensive omission of &lt;h&gt; in representing the product of nasal mutation of /p t k/ (not tagged)</li>
<li>pretonic /e/ and /o/ are often reduced to schwa, represented as &lt;y&gt; (partially tagged, but note the very common forms <span class="cited_text">dybyga</span> etc.)</li>
<li>conversely, schwa is sometimes represented as &lt;o&gt; (e.g. <span class="cited_text">conghorwr</span> for <span class="cited_text">cynghorwr</span> (10.11)) (generally tagged)</li>
<li>loss of pretonic /a/, /e/ and /o/, particularly in word-initial position (generally tagged)</li>
<li>appearance of &lt;o&gt; for stressed schwa (e.g. <span class="cited_text">dolwuth</span> for <span class="cited_text">dylwyth</span> (5.7))</li>
<li>/tl/ becomes /kl/ in <span class="cited_text">clws</span> (50.15) (tagged)</li>
<li>epenthetic /t/ or /d/ is found in some cases after <span class="IPA">/&#620;/</span> (not tagged)</li>
<li>palatalisation of /g/ (e.g. <span class="cited_text">giamp</span> (23.6), <span class="cited_text">llygied</span> (9.)) (tagged)</li>
<li>extensive use of &lt;w&gt; in place of &lt;wy&gt; (partially tagged)</li>
<li>fairly consistent use of the form <span class="cited_text">pen</span> for <span class="cited_text">pan</span> (not tagged)</li>
<li>subject pronouns ending in /i/ are often written simply as &lt;i&gt; after a verb (e.g. <span class="cited_text">clowsoch i</span> for <span class="cited_text">clywoch chi</span> (9.18)) (not tagged)</li>
<li>the root of the verb <span class="cited_text">canlyn</span> is <span class="cited_text">calyn-</span> (not tagged)</li>
<li>the root of the verb <span class="cited_text">dweud</span> is <span class="cited_text">doud-</span> or <span class="cited_text">doed-</span>  (not tagged)</li>
<li>various forms of the root of the verb <span class="cited_text">adnabod</span> are found (e.g. <span class="cited_text">daen-</span> (8.26), <span class="cited_text">doun-</span> (16.29) or <span class="cited_text">dwaun-</span> (27.7); verbnoun <span class="cited_text">dynabod</span> (3.26, 56.14)) (not tagged)</li>
<li>various inflected prepositional forms contain <span class="IPA">/&#952;/</span> (e.g. <span class="cited_text">rhyngthoch</span> (58.9)) (not tagged)</li>
<li>contractions of the aspectual <span class="cited_text">yn</span> plus genitive pronoun are found (e.g. <span class="cited_text">bum ich gwrando</span> (40.2)) (not tagged)</li>
<li>both <span class="cited_text">fo</span> and <span class="cited_text">fe</span> are used as particles / pronouns in front of the verb, although <span class="cited_text">fo</span> is more frequent (not tagged)</li>
<li>in postverbal position, the masculine third-person-singular pronoun is normally <span class="cited_text">o</span> (not tagged)</li>
</ul>

<p>Stage directions are variously at the right margin or apparently centred in the manuscript. Both are represented using the &lt;stage&gt; tag in the TEI-transcription, and the position on the page is not represented in the tagging. However, the position is given in a comment in the TEI-file at the relevant point, and this information can therefore be recovered if necessary. At several points, the manuscript contains an 'X' in the left margin. This is not represented in the TEI-transcription, but is noted in a comment in the TEI-file and can be recovered if necessary. Note that the TEI-file uses &lt;div type="prologue"&gt;, &lt;gap/&gt;, and &lt;trailer&gt; elements. A cast list is supplied.</p>

<p>The corpus editions generate line numbers for the text automatically. Stage directions, names of characters etc. are not assigned line numbers. At several points, an entire line is crossed out in the manuscript, and at another point, an entire stanza is deleted. Note that these lines are assigned line numbers (205, 624-7, and 1243). The number of lines lost in the damaged section of pages 13-14 cannot be assessed easily or with any certainty, and the missing lines have therefore not been assigned line numbers. In a few other cases of missing lines, it is generally possible to establish the number of lines lost and such lines have therefore been given numbers (for instance, 362-3). In the concordance files, stage directions etc. are referenced using the number of the immediately preceding line.</p>
